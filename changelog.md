## [2.0.1] - 2026-02-23 ##

### Added ###
- **Full-expression fallback for decision table input entries** — when `ParseSimpleUnaryTests` fails (e.g. Camunda-style `contains(...) or contains(...)` expressions), the engine now retries with `ParseExpression` (the full FEEL grammar supporting `or`/`and` operators). This improves compatibility with DMN files exported by Camunda and other tools that use full FEEL expressions in input entries rather than strict simple unary tests.
- **DMN file metadata in the testbed** — the `/api/dmn/info/{name}` endpoint now returns a `metadata` object containing DMN version, definition name, namespace, exporter, exporter version, execution platform, and a Camunda export indicator. The frontend displays this as a row of badges below the file selector with tooltips explaining each value.

### Fixed ###
- **Test suite now verifies upstream decision outputs** — when running test cases for a decision with upstream dependencies (DRD), the test runner now includes outputs from upstream decisions in the actual results. Previously, expected values for upstream outputs (e.g. `emailGroup` from an upstream "Email Group" decision) were not compared, causing tests to fail even when the quick test form showed correct results.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-19 ##
**This is a fork** of [adamecr/Common.DMN.Engine](https://github.com/adamecr/Common.DMN.Engine) (v1.1.1). The v2.0.0 release replaces the expression evaluation engine and makes several other substantial changes, making this a divergent fork rather than a drop-in upgrade. The original v1.x documentation is archived in [readme-v1.md](readme-v1.md). It's recommended to go through the [updated documentation](readme.md) for full details.

### Fork summary ###
- The expression evaluator has been completely replaced — DynamicExpresso removed in favour of a custom ANTLR4-based FEEL interpreter
- Three dependencies removed (`DynamicExpresso.Core`, `RadCommons.core`, multi-framework support), two added (`Antlr4.Runtime.Standard`, `Antlr4BuildTasks`)
- Target framework narrowed from .NET Standard 2.0 to .NET 10.0
- New FEEL-specific types introduced (`FeelTime`, `FeelYmDuration`, `FeelRange`, `FeelContext`, `FeelFunction`)
- DMN XML compatibility is preserved — existing DMN files parse identically, and S-FEEL expressions remain valid FEEL
- The C# API shape is largely preserved (`DmnParser`, `DmnDefinitionFactory`, `DmnExecutionContext`, `DmnDefinitionBuilder`) but has breaking changes at the type level (see below)

### Breaking changes ###
- **Target framework changed from .NET Standard 2.0 to .NET 10.0** — the library no longer supports .NET Framework or older .NET Core runtimes
- **DynamicExpresso replaced with full FEEL evaluator** — all expressions (expression decisions, decision table rule inputs, rule outputs) are now evaluated using an ANTLR4-based FEEL interpreter instead of DynamicExpresso. Existing S-FEEL expressions (`>5`, `[1..10]`, `not(5,7)`, `"hello"`, etc.) remain valid FEEL and evaluate identically.
- **FEEL type system** — data type mappings updated to align with the FEEL specification:
  - `date` now maps to `DateOnly` (was `DateTime`)
  - `time` maps to new `FeelTime` type
  - `date and time` maps to `DateTimeOffset` (was `DateTime`)
  - `years and months duration` maps to new `FeelYmDuration` type (calendar-based arithmetic)
  - `days and time duration` maps to `TimeSpan`
  - `number` maps to `decimal`
- **Removed `SfeelParser`** — S-FEEL expression parsing is now handled natively by the FEEL evaluator
- **Removed `DynamicExpresso.Core` dependency**
- **Removed `RadCommons.core` dependency** — logging uses NLog directly
- **Expression cache type changed** — cache stores `FeelAstNode` (immutable AST) instead of `DynamicExpresso.Lambda`. Cache key no longer includes output type (FEEL AST is type-independent).
- **Removed `ConfigureInterpreter` and `SetInterpreterParameters` virtual methods** from `DmnExecutionContext` — DynamicExpresso customization points no longer exist
- **Type mismatch behavior** — expressions with incompatible types (e.g., comparing string to number) return `null` instead of throwing exceptions, following FEEL three-valued logic
- **Removed multi-framework test projects** — consolidated into single `net.adamec.lib.common.dmn.engine.tests` targeting .NET 10.0
- **Duration arithmetic is calendar-based** — `date(2018-01-23) + duration(P3Y)` = `2021-01-23` (FEEL spec), not `2021-01-22` (365.25-day approximation as in v1.x)

### Added ###
- **Full FEEL evaluator** — ANTLR4-based lexer/parser with tree-walking interpreter supporting the complete FEEL expression language:
  - Arithmetic, comparison, logical operators with null propagation
  - `if`/`then`/`else`, `for`/`in`/`return`, `some`/`every` quantifiers
  - List operations (1-based indexing, negative indices, filters, paths)
  - Context expressions and nested context access
  - Range types with `contains()` semantics
  - Function definitions, named parameter invocation
  - ~80 built-in functions: string, numeric, list, date/time, context, range, boolean, conversion
- **Multi-word name resolution** — FEEL allows spaces in identifiers; `FeelNameResolver` uses longest-match semantics with `FeelScope` to resolve ambiguous token sequences
- **FEEL type wrappers** — `FeelTime`, `FeelYmDuration`, `FeelRange`, `FeelContext`, `FeelFunction` with full arithmetic and comparison support
- **FEEL three-valued logic** — `FeelValueComparer` implements null propagation, `and`/`or`/`not` with three-valued semantics
- **FEEL type coercion** — `FeelTypeCoercion` handles FEEL-to-CLR and CLR-to-FEEL conversions (singleton list ↔ scalar, numeric coercion to decimal, DateTime → DateTimeOffset)
- **DMN 1.4 and 1.5 XML parsing** — new namespaces and serializers for DMN 1.4 (`20211108/MODEL/`) and 1.5 (`20230324/MODEL/`)
- **Auto-detection of DMN version** — `DmnParser.ParseAutoDetect()` reads root element namespace to determine version automatically
- **Convenience parse methods** — `Parse14()`, `Parse15()`, `ParseString14()`, `ParseString15()`
- **CLR interop** — FEEL evaluator supports CLR instance method calls (`.ToString()`, `.Substring()`) and static method calls (`double.Parse()`, `Math.Abs()`) for backward compatibility
- **Cross-type date/time comparison** — `DateOnly` vs `DateTimeOffset`, `FeelTime` vs `DateTimeOffset` (compares time portions)

### Changed ###
- Target framework: .NET Standard 2.0 → .NET 10.0
- NLog updated from 4.x to 5.3.4
- Test projects consolidated into single project targeting .NET 10.0
- Simulator updated to .NET 10.0-windows, uses `ParseAutoDetect()` for DMN version detection
- MSTest updated to 3.x, FluentAssertions to 7.x

### Removed ###
- `DynamicExpresso.Core` package reference
- `RadCommons.core` package reference
- `parser/SfeelParser.cs`
- Multi-framework test projects (netcore31, netcore5, netcore6, net462, net472)
- `ConfigureInterpreter()` and `SetInterpreterParameters()` methods from `DmnExecutionContext`

## [1.1.1] - 2022-05-15 ##

### Fixed ###
Diagram Shape `Bounds` and Edged `Waypoint` properties are `double` now (changed in Parser, Definition, Simulator) according to the OMG standard. It was `int` in v1.1.0 and it blocked loading the DMN XML models with double values in boundaries due to a parser exception.
DmnDefinitionFactory ignores unsupported decision types 

### Added ###
Known types now recognize `number` as a `typeRef` in DMN XML and maps it to `decimal` .NET type

### Changed ###
`NormalizeVariableName` replace `-` (dash) with `_` (underscore). The name of (normalized) variable can also start with underscore
When there are multiple DI:Shapes for the same element within the diagram, the element will have multiple extensions, but the extension at Definition level will have just the last one.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-05-13 ##
As this is a major update, it's recommended to go through the [documentation](readme.md) for both "big picture" and the details.

### Breaking changes ###
- `DmnDefinitionFactory` - when building the definition, `RequiredInputs` now contain direct input requirements only (before v1.1.0, it did the recursive check through required decisions and added also the inputs required by them). 
- Removed support for .Net Core 2.1 
  - The library still might work when used in .Net Core 2.1 apps, however it's not being tested against .Net Core 2.1 anymore and no related fixes/updates are expected in future

### Fixed ###
- [Issue#15 Memory leak detected within DmnExecutionContext class](https://github.com/adamecr/Common.DMN.Engine/issues/15) - The (static) parsed expression cache have been split to instance dictionary (for Execution and Context scopes) and to static dictionary (for Definition and Global scopes). The purge methods for individual scopes have been added to `DmnExecutionContext` class. Thanks [@JoanRosell](https://github.com/JoanRosell) for identifying the issue. 
- `DmnDefinition` now implements `IDmnDefinition`

### Added ###
- `DmnParser.DmnVersionEnum.V1_3ext` - new version of algorithm and mapping when building the DmnDefinition from DMN XML. **Read the [documentation](readme.md) for details** as it might have the impact on the way how to prepare DMN XML models for DMN engine when using the extended version (1_3ext). The major change is for table inputs, mapping of table output attributes also changed.
- Support for *extensions* to DMN definition, decision and variable. These can be used to store and manage any custom data, however the engine doesn't "touch" the extensions during the execution. When parsing with version 1_3 and above, the DMN DI shape data are stored as extensions. More information is provided in the [documentation](readme.md).
- Information about `DmnParser.DmnVersionEnum` used/required is added to `DmnModel`. 
- DmnDefinition entities Decision, Variable, Table Input, Table Output now have also the `Label` and `NameWithLabel` properties that might be used for visualization (are not significant for execution).
- Demo application **DMN Engine Simulator** has been added as WPF application targeting .Net 6.0 (Desktop) to demonstrate features of DMN Engine. It uses the `DmnParser.DmnVersionEnum.V1_3ext` when reading the DMN XML files! 
- Support (and test project) for .Net 6.0

### Changed ###
- `DmnDefinitionFactory` protected methods are made virtual and the factory has been refactored a bit allowing to create the customized factories based on the DmnDefinitionFactory.
- Methods `GetAllRequiredInputs` and `GetAllRequiredDecisions` providing the required information through all dependency tree were added to `DmnDecision`.
- Method 'DmnVariableDefinition.NormalizeVariableName` allows the characters `?#$%&*()` in non-normalized variable name. These characters are removed during the normalization without throwing the exception. Public static method `CanNormalizeVariableName` has been added allowing to check the variable name "soft" way.
- Other
  - Referenced NuGet packages versions update
  - Solution now primary for VS2022 (was 2019)


## [1.0.1] - 2022-01-08 ##
### Fixed ###
- [Issue#11 NormalizeVariableName(string name)](https://github.com/adamecr/Common.DMN.Engine/issues/11) -  with the main fix in [PR#12 
allowing international letters like æøå](https://github.com/adamecr/Common.DMN.Engine/pull/12) by [@samuelsen](https://github.com/samuelsen). 

## [1.0.0] - 2021-12-29 ##
As this is a major update, it's recommended to go through the [documentation](readme.md) for both "big picture" and the details.

### Breaking change ###
- Decision table
  - **Allowed input values checks don't throw the exception when the constraint is violated** (see the documentation for more details)

### Added ###

- Definition classes
  - The DMN definition can be created also by code using the builders (`DmnDefinitionBuilder`)

- Execution context
  - New method `WithInputParameters` allowing to set multiple parameters in one call using the dictionary (`IReadOnlyCollection<KeyValuePair<string,object>>`)
  - Decision execution can be traced/audited using the snapshots
  - When the result comes from the decision table, it also provides the list of rules that had a positive hit. Thanks [Noel](https://github.com/nlysaght) for contribution.
  - Execution context can be configured using the `DmnExecutionContextOptions` when calling the factory - set the snapshots on/off, table rules parallel processing, parsed expressions cache
  - Parsed expression cache is now configurable 
  
- Tests
  - Shared code project with tests - "single test code"
    - Hierarchy of test classes for same test but different source (DMN XML 1.1/1.3 or builders)
    - Projects using the shared code targetting different platforms (.net core 2.1, 3.1, 5; .net framework 4.6.2, 4.7.2)

### Changed ###
- Definition classes
  - In general, trying to have kind of immutable public interface after constructed 
  - `DmnVariableDefinition` is "hidden" via R/O `IDmnVariable`. Also the setters are now not public (can be changed via dedicated methods encapsulating the logic)
  - `IDmnVariable` and `IDmnDecision` is used as reference to variable/decision definition
  - `IReadOnlyCollection` is used for required inputs and decision
  - Arrays are used instead of lists for decision table - Inputs, Outpus, Rules, Allowed values

- Execution context
  - Properties are published as `IReadOnlyDictionary` instead of `IDictionary`
  - Parsed expressions cache (static property) is `ConcurrentDictionary` now
  - `DmnExecutionContextFactory` class is static now
  - The execution related classes have been better adapted for the support of extended/customized functionality using the inheritance
  
- Other
  - DynamicExpresso, NLog packages updated to current versions 
  - Solution now primary for VS2019 (was 2017)
  - Updated documentation with more details in some parts
 
### Fixed ###
- When cloning the variables (for example from context to result), the ICloneable value is clonned properly
- DmnExecutionVariable.SetInputParameterValue - type/cast check
- [Issue#8](https://github.com/adamecr/Common.DMN.Engine/issues/8) - ParsedExpressionsCache Corruption when running multiple concurrent evaluations

## [0.1.2] - 2020-07-18 ##
### Added ###
- Support for parsing the DMN 1.3 documents (no additional functionality, just XML namespaces adjustments)

## [0.1.1] - 2019-11-03 ##
### Fixed ###
- Issue with serializer in full .NET framework as described by [@fgollas](https://github.com/fgollas) in [PR#1](https://github.com/adamecr/Common.DMN.Engine/pull/1). Proxy classes are used when there are "hidden" model properties without getters. Added the tests running on .NET framework (the v 0.1.0 code has been tested just for .NET core, where this issue not appeared).
- Some small corrections in read.me
